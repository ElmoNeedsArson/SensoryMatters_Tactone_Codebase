# Creating Your Own Silicone Pads Guide
Tactone cosists of four demo pads with each allowing different tactile experiences. The demo pads are: big bubles, small bubbles, soft spikes, and hard spikes. These four pads allow different tactile interactions, however you can explore your own pads as well. Here we will discuss how to make such a pad and what dimensions to keep in mind. 

Practicalities 

The pads are 18cm in length and 15 cm in width. Each pad consist of three parts, a top layer, a middle layer, and a two part bottom layer. For the top layer ecoflex 30 is used, as this silicone is more flexible allowing for more actuation. For the other layers eurosil 33 is used, as this silicone is more sturdy and harder to bend.  

Design your pad 

With the top and middle layer you can change the design of the pad. The middle layer, divides the air into different compartments, creating large or small bubbles in the top sheet. The size of the bubbles is dependent on the size of the holes in the middle sheet. So in the middle layer you can experiment with the size and shape of the bubbles. 

If you want to create bubbles you can keep the top layer flat. For soft spikes you can create a top layer with spike indents. You can also experiment with the thickness of the top layer, as this influences the actuation. The four demo pads all have a top layer with a thickness of 2mm. We would recommend to not make the top layer thicker than that as this would make actuation a lot more difficult and less apparent.  

The two bottom layers should not be changed as they create the compartments preventing the bottom from ballooning.  

Casting process 

Each layer should be casted one by one.  

Middle layer 

So, one should start by casting the middle layer and let this set for 3 hours (the demolding time of the silicone). After that you should cut away the access silicone making the silicone layer as clean as possible.  

Top layer 

Then the top layer can be casted with ecoflex 30. When the top layer is still in its pouring time, the middle layer should be laid flat on top. No weight should be put on top of the middle layer, as the middle layer then sinks too much into the top layer. After the demolding time of the toplayer is over, the top and middle layer should be attached to each other.  

Bottom layer 1 

Now onto the first bottom layer which will lead to compartmentalization of the pad. Here inner and outer walls are casted onto the middle layer. After the demolding time one can remove the inner and outer walls. After that you should cut away the access silicone making the silicone layer as clean as possible. Then you can create two tube holes in the outer wall on the back of the pad. Once the holes are created and the tubes are put into place one can cast the final layer. 

Bottom layer 2 

This is the final layer of the silicone pad, the bottom to seal the pad. First the bottom is poured and then the cured silicone pad is put on top of the bottom. The walls don’t need to be pressed hard into the bottom, just make sure all the walls and corners are inside the mould. You can put some extra weight on the tubes, to make sure they are in contact with the curing silicone. However, too much weight can lead to tubes being closed of by the bottom silicone. So be careful with this. 

As the layers are cast one after another, silicone glue is not needed anymore, making the pad stronger and more airtight.  

Once the pads are fully cured you measure the thickness of the pad. Depending on the thickness you have to alter the 3D printed casing of the pad. As all the pads should be leveled, the thickness should be … mm. So if your pad is a bit thinner you need to print a thicker bottom layer, to level it out. Once the casing is printed you can glue the top and bottom of the casing on to the silicone pad, sealing it with super glue. After this is done, you are ready to use your pad in Tactone.
